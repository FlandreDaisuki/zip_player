== Introduction ==

zip_player is a JavaScript library to load and play back animated images
packaged as an uncompressed ZIP archive containing individual frames.
Frames are drawn onto a Canvas element and may be any image MIME type
supported by the browser (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF - though animated GIFs are not
supported for obvious reasons).

It also supports an unpacked mode where the images are directly referenced as
individual URLs (e.g. data: URLs for client-side preview purposes).

== Dependencies ==

no

== Usage ==

Open test/index.html for an example. Note that you need to serve it from a web
server with Range support for zip mode to work (unpacked mode does not require
Range support).

== Browser compatibility ==

- Any recent Chrome or Firefox
- Safari 7+ (?)
- IE 10+ (?)
- iOS 5+ (6+ recommended, 5 is slow due to lack of Blob URL support) (?)
- Android browser 4.0+ (?)

== Testing ==

```
$ npm i
$ npm run debug
```
